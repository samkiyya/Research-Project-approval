## Project Proposal

Our project focuses on creating a comprehensive personal portfolio that not only highlights individual skills and projects but also demonstrates our ability to manage and deliver a project from concept to completion.

### Key Objectives

- To design a visually appealing portfolio with a modern user interface.
- To implement responsive design practices ensuring the portfolio works seamlessly across devices.
- To integrate a backend for dynamic content management, if needed.
- To utilize Trello for task management and to keep the project on track.

## MVP Specification

### Problem Statement

The problem we aim to solve is the lack of a centralized, well-designed portfolio that showcases an individual's technical skills, projects, and professional achievements in an engaging manner.

### MVP Goals

- **Landing Page**: A concise introduction with links to other sections of the portfolio.
- **Project Showcase**: A display of key projects with detailed descriptions, screenshots, and links to GitHub repositories.
- **Skills Section**: A categorized list of skills highlighting expertise in frontend and backend technologies, as well as tools.
- **Contact Form**: An interactive form allowing potential employers or collaborators to reach out.

### Challenges

- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- Making the design fully responsive to cater to various screen sizes.

## Trello Board Setup

A Trello board has been set up to track the progress of our project. The board is divided into the following columns:

- **Proposed**
- **Approved**
- **In Progress**
- **Dev Complete**
- **Tested**
- **Deployed**

### Task Cards

Each task related to the MVP has been broken down into cards with detailed descriptions, mockups, diagrams, or technical specifications. The tasks have been assigned to team members with appropriate due dates, considering dependencies and priorities.

- **Create Presentation**
- **Create Project Landing Page**
- **Write Comprehensive README.md**
- **Make Demo of the Project**
- **Write Blog Post**
